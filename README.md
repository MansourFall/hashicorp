Deploy  [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) with Ansible.
Playbook based on the great following repo : https://github.com/AvalancheDev/Hashicorp-Vault-Ansible

## Setup
1)A "file" storage is specified as storage backend in the vaultconfig.hcl file.
__NOTE__: You can use a different storage backend, just be make sure to edit the vaultconfig.hcl.
2) Edit the hosts file to add in the host you are deploying to.
3) Run the following command: `ansible-playbook -i myhosts vault-deploy.yml`
4) Be sure to save all of the keys that get generated by the `Initialize the Vault` step. __THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT__, if you lose these keys you will not be able to access your vault server. It is reccommended to distribute the keys among people, such that no one person has access to unlocking the entire vault. Keys should be stored with PGP encryption.
5) Once this is finished, you'll need to unseal the vault. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/deploy.html#seal-unseal). You will need the secrets that you just saved to do this.

At this point, your vault server should be up and running.

## System Requirements
Vault itself will vary in the system requirements needed, but as far as the operating system goes, this playbook has only been tested with Ubuntu 20.04.
